   You can use the ":AllBuffersToOneWindow" command to load buffers that are
   loaded in remote Vim window in main Vim window.

   1. Run Vim application (process A), and edit File1, File2, FIle3.
   2. Run Vim application (process B), and edit File4, File5
   3. Run Vim application (process C), and input ":AllBuffersToOneWindow"
      command.
   4. Input ":buffers" command. (Vim application process C)
      File1, File2, File3, File4 and File5 are added to buffer list.

Note:
   o  To run this script, Vim needs to be compiled with "+clientserver" option.

   o  If buffer is already loaded in main window, buffer will not be loaded.
